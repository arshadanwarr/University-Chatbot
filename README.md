# University-Chatbot

🚀 Just launched: UETM Chatbot – Your Personalized Guide to University of Engineering & Technology Admissions! 🎓🤖

Proud to share my latest project — a smart, PDF-powered chatbot built with LangChain, OpenRouter (LLM API), and Streamlit!

📌 What it does:
This chatbot reads and understands the official UETM Prospectus 2024-25 (PDF) and can answer any questions students or parents may have about admissions, programs, eligibility, campuses, and more.

💡 Key Features:

🧠 Conversational memory using LangChain’s ConversationBufferMemory

🔍 PDF data extraction via PyPDFLoader

🔗 Semantic search with HuggingFace Embeddings + FAISS Vectorstore

💬 Real-time Q&A using DeepSeek Chat hosted via OpenRouter

🖥️ Fully interactive web interface built in Streamlit

🔐 API keys and config are securely managed using .env and python-dotenv.

This project demonstrates how AI + NLP can simplify complex documents for everyday users — making information accessible, interactive, and conversational. 📚🤝
